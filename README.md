Shadow Libraries
=========

A pirate libraries archive.

The name of this site comes from the [homonym book  edited by Joe Karaganis](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/shadow-libraries).
**Shadow libraries**, sometimes called pirate libraries, consist of texts aggregated outside the legal framework of copyright. The purpose of this channel, then, is to have all these libraries at our fingertips when in need of a certain text or book.

**Contribute:** Am I missing some other important libraries that should be there? Please send me an e-mail to shadowlibraries [@] protonmail.com

Site was made using [Hugo Framework](https://gohugo.io/), [Hugo-book theme](https://github.com/alex-shpak/hugo-book/) and some tweaks.
